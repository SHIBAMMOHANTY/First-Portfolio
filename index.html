                <p>A landing page is an ideal web development project for beginners. It requires basic
                    knowledge of HTML and CSS. Through this project, you'll learn to create columns, divide
                    sections, arrange items, and add headers and footers. The most important aspect is
                    unleashing your creativity to design an impressive page. Pay attention to alignments,
                    padding, color palette, boxes, and other elements. Be mindful of CSS to avoid overlapping
                    elements. In short, a landing page project allows you to apply HTML and CSS skills,
                    encouraging your creativity while ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design.</p>
